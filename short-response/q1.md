# Question

In your own words, what is React and what are the benefits of using it?

# Answer

A framework that complies CSS, Javascript and HTML into one. It's less of a new language and more of a library that's widely used.

The benefit of using it are:

Instead of using DOM manipulation, react allows it so you can make code that acts and functions like regular Javascript but all the while implementing HTML elements.

Fast rendering.

Streamline code that isn't nearly as clunky as DOM manipulation.

Very flexible, and is very popular.
